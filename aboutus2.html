                <p>I currently attend Benjamin Banneker High School as a junior. My hobbies include, coding and running my candle business. My career goals are to become a full-stack engineer and eventually start my own coding company. While apart Young Gifted Techie I faced only one challenge which was time management, I felt like I had so little time to complete so much. While in the program I enjoyed interacting with my peers and obtaining new knowledge about coding.</p>

My career goal is to become an NFL star and give back to the community. A challenge I faced while apart of Young Gifted Techie was staying on track, I tend to get off track easily these days. Somethings I enjoyed about the class was my instructor Ms.Kendra, the lessons we learned every week, the environment, and the food. </p>

                <p class="role">Software Developer</p>
                <p>I'm currently a freshman at Langston Hughes High School. I enjoy playing sports such as football and basketall. In my spare time I play videogames, scroll on TikTok, sleep, and go outside. My career goals are playing college football and to work within the engineering field. One of the challenges I faced while apart of this program is taking notes, I have a bad habit of taking notes. The thing I enjoyed the most about Young Gifted Techie was the food, the fun I had, and the fact that I'm 14 years old learning multi million dollar material.
